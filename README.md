# Customer Segmentation Project

## Overview

The Customer Segmentation project aims to classify customers into different groups based on their purchasing behavior. This allows businesses to better understand their customers and create targeted marketing strategies.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project includes customer demographic details, purchasing history, and behavioral data. Common attributes include:

- Customer ID
- Age
- Gender
- Annual Income
- Spending Score

## Methodology

1. **Data Preprocessing**: Handling missing values, data cleaning, and standardization.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualizing trends, distributions, and relationships among variables.
3. **Feature Selection & Scaling**: Selecting relevant features and normalizing data.
4. **Clustering Algorithms**: Applying unsupervised machine learning techniques such as:
   - K-Means Clustering
5. **Evaluation**: Using metrics like silhouette score and inertia to assess clustering quality.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas & NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib & Seaborn

## Results

The project successfully grouped customers into different segments, revealing patterns in customer behavior. These insights can be used to improve marketing strategies and customer engagement.

## Future Improvements

- Implementing deep learning techniques for better segmentation.
- Including real-time customer data for dynamic segmentation.
